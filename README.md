#Make Beto Run!

##Introduction

This game is a variation of the classic Tetris block stacking and fitting game. The game is set in the context of the 2020 presidential election, for which many democrats have enlisted to challenge President Trump. Beto O'Rourke was the Texas Senatorial candidate challenging incumbent Ted Cruz during the 2018 midterm election cycle, and garnered a huge amount of national attention, which prompted many voters across the country to put their support behind Beto as the 2020 Democratic candidate. While there has been much speculation behind his decision, he has not formally announced his candidacy. 

In this game, the player will be arranging "bricks" (tetrominoes), with the goal of building Trump's notorious border wall by making complete rows. As the player lays down rows of brick, Beto starts running, and points are added to the player's score.

The user may click on the "How to Play" button to read instructions: (wireframe 2)

When the user clicks "Start", the game will begin. Bricks of different shapes drop from the top of the gameplay grid, one at a time. A player may use their arrow keys to shift the piece down and from left to right, or may rotate the piece using the space bar. Once a brick reaches the bottom of the grid, it is frozen in place and the controls shift to the new piece in play. As players make complete rows on the grid, points are added to the player's current score, and the Beto animation begins to run. When the animation has finished running, it will not begin again until more rows are complete. The player attempts build complete rows for the duration of one round, which lasts one and a half minutes.

When time has ended, a game over prompt will be shown with the player's final score, and a message challenging the user to play again and achieve a higher score.
